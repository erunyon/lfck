In the noise of the world....<br/>
We teach our students to be still.<br/>
In the face of negative peer pressure...<br/>
We instill the confidence our students need to do the right thing.<br/>
In our interaction with our students...<br/>
We teach them humility.<br/>
In a world of &ldquo;do what feels good&rdquo;...<br/>
We help our students to understand self-control.

Our classes are designed to help students develop &ldquo;mind, body, and spirit&rdquo;. The classes incorporate physical fitness, character development, and leadership training.

- We are a faith-based martial arts ministry that develops Biblical character in our students through scripture memorization, devotion time, and martial arts practice.
- We are a non-denominational evangelical parachurch organization.
- We exist to help support and further the body of Christ as a whole.
- We accept students without regard for race, color, religion, sex, age, or disability.
