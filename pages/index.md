As a kenpo school ministry, we have a faith-based martial arts system that develops Biblical character in our students through scripture memorization, devotion time, and martial arts practice. Our students are taught to use their Bibles. They are taught to memorize scripture. We encourage our students to be more active in their local churches. If any student or students are not attending church we encourage them to join us here at Calvary. Also, we teach them to do all things wholeheartedly to the honor and glory of God.(Col. 3:23) They are taught that this way of living is not for favor, but that it is a way to live our lives that tells our Savior/Creator that we love Him.

As an evangelistic ministry we have martial arts demonstrations that create an opportunity to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ. As a support ministry to the local churches we use the same type of demonstrations to create opportunities to encourage children and youth, who know Christ as Savior, in their daily walk with Him.

As a rape prevention ministry, we give women tools for protecting themselves. We share the hope that Christ offers with those who have survived domestic violence and or sexual assault. The ministry can be preventative but is also vital to the healing process. “Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the future.” Proverbs 31:25 NASB

_Life for Christ Karate Ministries is governed by a board of directors. It is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt corporation. The ministry is made up primarily of volunteer help. The leadership team is direct fruit of God's work in this ministry._
